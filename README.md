## Description
This series of [Google Earth Engine (GEE)](https://code.earthengine.google.com/) JavaScript scripts was developed as part of a basic training on using Earth Observations to map fire occurrence in Lao PDR for NASA SERVIR.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this series was to demonstrate how Earth Observations related to fire hotspots, burned areas, and vegetation and climate measurements can be used to visualize fire hotspots, map burned area, and create a simple fire risk map.

## Context
These scripts were developed by the SERVIR Science Coordination Office in collaboration with the Asian Disaster Preparedness Center. Learner needs assessments and scoping were conducted by Aekkapol Aekakkararungroj. Code was written by [Kaitlin Walker](https://github.com/katieailsa) (NASA / UAH).
